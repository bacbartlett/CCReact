Our Reforestation Hubs are building a circular economy for urban forestsâ€”reclaiming city wood waste and generating revenues to plant and maintain trees. These hubs can create sustainable new jobs and help build the resilient cities that the 21st century demands. By focusing on tree equity, workforce development, and investment in local businesses, Cambium is creating a better future for people and the planet.</p>
